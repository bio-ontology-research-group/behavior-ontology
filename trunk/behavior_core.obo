comment: Many different actions are included in locomotor play. Some of the actions include a vertical leap, running in circles, chasing an animals own tail, lolloping, bouncing, bucking, rolling, whirling, dangling, spinning, back flips, hand stands, somersaults, and hanging upside down. The vertical leap is seen in mammals like in primates, hares, and mice. Along with running and bouncing, the vertical leap is important for strengthening leg muscles for self defense, escaping, or chasing. Activities like dangling and hanging upside down are important for improving climbing ability. These many different examples of locomotor play are important in strengthening muscles and improving motor skills. By participating in locomotor play, individuals will be able to improve skills like fighting, hunting, fleeing, and climbing.

comment: Play fighting helps learning to evaluate oneself and an opponent. This skill is crucial for serious adult situations. Being able to size up an opponent quickly is very important in knowing when to give up or fight for a resource (food, mate, territory, etc. ). Play fighting is one of the most important categories of play because it prepares animals for actual fighting.
